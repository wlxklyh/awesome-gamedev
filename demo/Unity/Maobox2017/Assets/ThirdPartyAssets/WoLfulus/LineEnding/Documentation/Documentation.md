## Overview 

This asset contains a script that automatically fixes line endings on your script based. It'll watch the logs of the console for reports of mixed line endings and automatically fix it for you based on your line-ending choice.

## Configuration

To configure which type of line ending you want, just go to **Tools** > **Line Endings Fixer** and select which line ending you want for your project.

Note that there's no "batch" processing, only scripts reported on console will be fixed.
