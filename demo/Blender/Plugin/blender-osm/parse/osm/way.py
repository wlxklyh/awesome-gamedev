class Way:
    """
    A class to represent an OSM way
    
    Some attributes:
        l (app.Layer): layer used to place the related geometry to a specific Blender object
        t: type for rendering (Render.polygon, Render.linestring)
        tags (dict): OSM tags
        m: A manager used during the rendering; if None, <manager.BaseManager> applies defaults
            during the rendering
        r (bool): Defines if we need to render (True) or not (False) the OSM way
            in the function <manager.BaseManager.render(..)>
        rr: A special renderer for the OSM way
        used (bool): Defines if the OSM way is already used (True) for bounds calculation or not (False)
        closed (bool): Defines if the OSM way forms a closed (True) or open (False) linestring
        n (bool): The number of OSM nodes in the OSM way; if the OSM way is closed,
            the number is decreased by 1
        o (tuple): Defines the related outline for a building part (building:part=*);
            has the form (osmId, osmElement); set only in the case of 3D buildings
        b (building.manager.Building): A related 3D Building; set only for 3D buildings
        o (tuple): Defines the related outline for a building part (building:part=*);
            has the form (osmId, osmElement); set only in the case of 3D buildings
