# Blender Addon for Wavefront OBJ with Vertex Color

Blender Addon to import/export Wavefront OBJ with Vertex Color. This addon is based on [the official blender addon](https://github.com/blender/blender-addons).

So far the testing is not really sufficient. If you have any troubles importing / exporting your .obj data, please report an issue.

## Installation

1. Download zip of this repository.
2. Open your blender 2.8
3. Navigate to `Preferences --> Add-ons`
4. Press `Install` and select the downloaded zip
5. Enable the addon
6. Done. You can import Wavefront OBJ with vertex color from `File --> Import --> Wavefront with VC (.obj)`, or export it in the same way.
